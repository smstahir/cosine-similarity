Tweet Similarity
In this project we used to find the cosine similarity between tweets. First by making the code to learn from a set of training tweets and then a testing tweets will be processed against all the training tweets and will find the cosine similarity against each tweet.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Operating System: Ubuntu
g++ compiler and path should be set
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running
•	A Makefile in the folder is already available just open terminal and run make it will compile the cpp files.
•	Now to run the program write ./program it will start running the exe file 
Running the tests
When the project starts it will ask for input files give the name like
